# Using Python with Amazon Web Services

I wrote an [article](http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=3997) on the the
new [AWS Python Developer Center](http://aws.amazon.com/python/). It details how to use [boto](http://github.com/boto)
and [Fabric](http://docs.fabfile.org/0.9.1/) to deploy systems on AWS. I also talk about Django integration
with SimpleDB and how to deploy [Redis](http://code.google.com/p/redis/) using [EBS](http://aws.amazon.com/ebs/).
